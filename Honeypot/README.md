# Honeypot Attack Simulation

## Overview
The Honeypot Attack Simulation project is an educational tool designed to simulate and analyze various network attacks. It features a custom-built honeypot that listens for incoming connections, generates dynamic responses, and records the behavior of potential attackers. Simultaneously, a simulated attacker script attempts different types of attacks against the honeypot, allowing users to see how the system responds.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Response Generation**: The honeypot generates custom responses based on the number of interactions from a particular IP, making it more challenging for attackers to identify it as a decoy.
- **Traffic Analysis**: Monitors incoming connections and flags IP addresses that exceed a set threshold, indicating suspicious activity.
- **Attack Simulation**: Simulates a range of network attacks, including:
  - SYN Flood
  - UDP Flood
  - HTTP GET and POST Requests
  - Simulated Connection Timeouts
- **Geolocation Tracking**: Uses IP-based geolocation to provide insights into the origin of each connection, offering context for analyzing potential threats.
- **Logging**: Records activity from both the honeypot and the simulated attacks, creating logs that can be used for further analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For implementing the honeypot and attack simulation logic.
- **Socket Programming**: To manage network connections and simulate attack scenarios.
- **Multithreading**: Ensures the honeypot can handle multiple connections simultaneously.
- **Requests Library**: For geolocation lookups based on IP addresses.
- **Logging Module**: To record events and actions from both the honeypot and simulated attacker.

## Learning Experience

This project has been a significant learning opportunity, especially as I am new to the field of cybersecurity. It provided hands-on experience with:

Understanding how network protocols work.
Implementing a basic honeypot to attract and analyze malicious traffic.
Simulating real-world attack scenarios to observe and log the behavior of a system under attack.
Using Python for network programming and multithreaded application development.

I plan to expand this project by adding a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the data analysis and interaction more user-friendly, turning it into a more interactive tool for other beginners in cybersecurity.


## Disclaimer
 
 Educational Purpose Only: This project is intended solely for learning and educational purposes. It is designed to provide a practical understanding of network security concepts like honeypots and attack simulations. It should not be used for malicious activities or against any unauthorized systems.

 ## Future Enhancements

 GUI Dashboard: A user interface to display connection logs, attack patterns, and geolocation data visually.

Enhanced Detection Mechanisms: Implement more sophisticated techniques for detecting and classifying attack types.

Extended Attack Simulation: Simulate more complex attacks to test the honeypot's resilience and analyze the results.
